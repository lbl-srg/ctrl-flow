   How to extract CDL part (to be translated) from whole system model?

   * Specification with the configuration widget of "unbreakable" parts of the control sequence.
   * Also need to 1) expand arrays into scalar instances and connections 2) suppress bus gateway variables ``connect(v1, bus.v); connect(v2, bus.v)`` into ``connect(v1, v2)`` unless supported by CDL spec. & translator?

   Devise how return status signals can be generated for components that do not have built-in output status variables.

   * Typically the pump model: difficult to implement without state event, otherwise short circuit the input control signal potentially with a ``pre`` operator.

   Allow for top level controller XOR individual controllers.

   Specify more the tagging process and how it can support mapping with equipment characteristics and sizing from data & sizing sheets.

   * EIKON uses two concepts: *reference* (used programmatically) and *display* (used for UI only) name.
   * HVAC zone, floor, room name is enough?


.. _sec_general_description:

General Description
-------------------

Main Requirements
*****************

The software is primarily a graphical user interface for editing Modelica models in a diagrammatic form: see :numref:`sec_functionalities` and :numref:`sec_modelica_gui`.

Built around this core functionality the following additional features are required:

#. A configuration widget supporting assisted modeling based on a simple HTML input form: see :numref:`sec_configuration_widget`

#. A schematics export functionality: see :numref:`sec_schematics_export`

#. A set of functionalities to enable working with tagged variables: see :numref:`sec_tagged_variables`

In terms of software design:

* The software must rely on client side JS code with minimal dependencies and must be built down to a single page HTML document (SPA).

* A widget structure is required that allows seamless embedding into:

  * a desktop app -- with standard access to the local file system,

  * a standalone web app -- with access to the local file system limited to Download & Upload functions of the web browser (potentially with an additional sandbox file system to secure backup in case the app enters an unknown state),

  * any third party application with the suitable framework to serve a single page HTML document executing JS code -- with access to the local file system through the API of the third party application:

    * the primary target is `OpenStudio® <https://www.openstudio.net>`_ (OS),

    * an example of a JS application embedded in OS is `FloorspaceJS <https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/geometry_editor>`_. The standalone SPA lives here: `https://nrel.github.io/floorspace.js <https://nrel.github.io/floorspace.js>`_. FloorspaceJS can be considered as a reference for the development.

  .. note::

     Those three integration targets are actual deliverables.

* A Python or Ruby API is required to access the data model and leverage the main functionalities of the software in a programmatic way e.g. by `OpenStudio measures <http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/measure_writing_guide/>`_.

UI Visual Structure
*******************

A minimal mockup of the UI is presented :numref:`screen_mockup`.

.. figure:: img/screen_mockup.svg
   :name: screen_mockup

   UI Visual Structure

The minimal requirements are:

* Left panel: library navigator

* Main panel: model editor with diagram, icon, documentation or code view

* Right panel:

  * Configuration tab, see :numref:`sec_configuration_widget`
  * Connections tab, see :numref:`sec_connect_ui_req`
  * Parameters tab, see :numref:`sec_parameters`

* Menu bar

* Bottom panel: console

The placement of the different UI elements might be different than the one proposed here above but the user must have access to all those elements.
Ideally a toggle feature should be implemented to show or hide each side panel, either by user click if the panel is pinned or automatically.
Optionally a fully customizable workspace may be implemented.

.. _sec_modelica_gui:

Modelica Graphical User Interface
---------------------------------

The software must comply with the Modelica language specification :cite:`Modelica2017` for every aspect relating to (the chapter numbers refer to :cite:`Modelica2017`):

* validating the syntax of the user inputs: see *Chapter 2 Lexical Structure* and *Chapter 3 Operators and Expressions*,

* the connection between objects: see *Chapter 9 Connectors and Connections*,

* the structure of packages: see *Chapter 13 Packages*,

* the annotations: see *Chapter 18 Annotations*.

.. note::

   When drawing a connection line between two connector icons in the diagram view:

   * a ``connect`` equation with the references to the two connectors must be created,

   * with a graphical annotation defining the connection path as an array of points and providing an optional smoothing function e.g. Bezier.

   * When no smoothing function is specified the connection path must be rendered graphically as a set of segments.

   * The array of points must be either:

     * created fully automatically when the next user's click after having started a connection is made on a connector icon. The function call ``create_new_path(connector1, connector2)`` creates the minimum number of *vertical or horizontal* segments to link the two connector icons with the constraint of avoiding overlaying any instantiated object,

     * created semi automatically based on the input points corresponding to the user clicks outside any connector icon: the function call ``create_new_path(point[i], point[i+1])`` is called to generate the path linking each pair of points together.

   * The first and last couple of points must be so that the connection line does not overlap the component icon but rather grows the distance to it, see :numref:`linkage_connect_distance`.

.. _sec_configuration_widget:

Configuration Widget
--------------------

Functionalities
***************

The configuration widget allows the user to generate a Modelica model of an HVAC system and its controls by filling up a simple input form.
It is mostly needed for integrating advanced control sequences that can have dozens of I/O variables.
The intent is to reduce the complexity to the mere definition of the system's layout and the selection of standard control sequences already transcribed in Modelica :cite:`OBC`.

.. note::

   `CtrlSpecBuilder <https://www.ctrlspecbuilder.com/ctrlspecbuilder/home.do;jsessionid=4747144EA3E61E9B82B9E0B463FF2E5F>`_ is a tool widely used in the HVAC controls industry for specifying control sequences. It might be used as a reference for the development in terms of user experience minimal functionalities. Note that this software does not provide any Modelica modeling functionality.

There are fundamental requirements regarding the Modelica model generated by the configuration widget:

1. It must be "graphically readable" (both within LinkageJS and within any third-party Modelica GUI e.g. Dymola): this is a strong constraint regarding the placement of the composing objects and the connections that must be generated automatically.

2. It must be ready to simulate: no additional modeling work or parameters setting is needed outside the configuration widget.

3. It must contain all annotations needed to regenerate the HTML input form when loaded, with all entries corresponding to the actual state of the model.

   * Manual modifications of the Modelica model made by the user are not supported by the configuration widget: an additional annotation should be included in the Modelica file to flag that the model has deviated from the template. In this case the configuration widget is disabled when loading that model.

4. The implementation of control sequences must comply with OpenBuildingControl requirements, see *§7 Control Description Language* and *§8 Code Generation* in :cite:`OBC`. Especially:

   * It is required that the CDL part of the model can be programmatically isolated from the rest of the model in order to be translated into vendor-specific code (by means of a third-party translator).
   * The expandable connectors (control bus) are not part of CDL specification: **how to represent communication between sub-systems?**

The input form is provided by the template developer (e.g. LBL) in a data model with a format that is to be further specified in collaboration with the software developer.

The data model typically provides for each entry:

* the HTML widget and populating data to be used for requesting user input,
* the modeling data required to instantiate, position and set up the parameters of the different components,
* some tags to be used to automatically generate the connections between the different components connectors.

The user interface logic is illustrated in figures :numref:`screen_conf_0` and :numref:`screen_conf_1`. Note that the comments in those figures are part of the requirements.

.. figure:: img/screen_conf_0.svg
   :name: screen_conf_0

   Configuration widget -- Configuring a new model

.. figure:: img/screen_conf_1.svg
   :name: screen_conf_1

   Configuration widget -- Configuring an existing model

The envisioned data structure supporting this logic consists in:

* placement coordinates provided relatively to a simplified grid, see :numref:`grid` -- those are to be mapped to Modelica diagram coordinates by the widget,

* an ``equipment`` section referencing the components that must be connected together with fluid connectors, see :numref:`sec_fluid_connectors`,

* a ``controls`` section referencing the components that must connected together with signal connectors, see :numref:`sec_signal_connectors`,

* a ``dependencies`` section referencing additional components with the following characteristics:

  * they typically correspond to sensors and outside fluid connectors,
  * the model completeness depends on their presence,
  * the requirements for their presence can be deduced from the equipment and controls options,
  * they do not need additional fields in the user form of the configuration widget.

The equipment and controls models are connected together by means of a *control bus*, see :numref:`screen_schematics_modelica`: the upper-level model including the equipment and controls models is the ultimate output of the configuration widget (see :numref:`screen_conf_1` where the component named ``AHU_1_01_02`` represents an instance of the upper-level model ``AHU_1`` generated by the widget). That component exposes the outside fluid connectors as well as the top level control bus.

The logic for instantiating classes from the library is straightforward. Each field of the form specifies:

* the path of the class to be instantiated depending on the user input;

* the position of the component in simplified grid coordinates to be converted in diagram view coordinates.

The next paragraphs address how the connections between the connectors of the different components are generated automatically based on this initial model structure.

.. note::

   :underline:`Data Structure Format`

   * JSON

     * Expensive syntax especially for boolean conditions or auto-referencing the data structure: is there any standard syntax?

   * Specific format to be defined in collaboration with the UI developer and depending on the selected UI framework

     A robust syntax is required for:

     * auto-referencing the data structure e.g. ``#type.value`` refers to the value of the field ``value`` of the object which ``$id`` is ``type``,

     * conditional statements: potentially every field might require a conditional statement -- either data fields (e.g. the model to be instantiated and its placement) or UI fields (e.g. the condition to enable a widget itself or the different options of a menu widget).

     * Ideally the syntax should also allow iteration ``for`` loops to instantiate a given number (as parameter) of objects with an offset applied to the placement coordinates e.g. chiller plant with ``n`` chillers. Backup strategy: define all (e.g. 10) possible instances and enable only the first ``n`` ones based on a condition.

   :underline:`Reference Guideline for Controls Specification`

   * Providing a reference guideline for controls specification conditionally disables all controls options that do not comply with that guideline.

   :underline:`Parameters Exposed by the Configuration Widget`

   * The template developer is free to declare in the template any parameter of the composing components e.g. ``V_flowSup_nominal`` and reference them in the model declaration e.g. ``Buildings.Fluid.Movers.SpeedControlled_y(m_flow_nominal=(#air_supply.medium).rho_default / 3600 * #V_flowSup_nominal.value)``. The configuration widget must replace the referenced names by their actual values (literal or numerical). The user will be able to override those values in the parameters panel e.g. if he wants to specify a different nominal air flow rate for the heating or cooling coil. See additional requirements regarding the persistance of those references in :numref:`sec_persisting_data`.

   * Some parameters *need* to be integrated in the template (examples are provided in reference to ``Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36_PR1.AHUs.MultiZone.VAV.Controller``):

     * when they impact the model structure e.g. ``use_enthalpy`` requires an additional enthalpy sensor: in that case the model declaration must use the ``final`` qualifier to prevent the user from overriding those values in the parameters panel,

     * when no default value is provided e.g. ``AFlo`` cf. requirement that the model generated by the configuration widget must be ready to simulate.


.. figure:: img/grid.png
   :name: grid

   Simplified grid providing placement coordinates for all objects to be instantiated when configuring an AHU model


For each object, the fields are defined as follows. When the type of a field is specified as a string marked with (C) it may correspond to:

* a conditional statement provided as a string that must be interpreted by the UI engine,
* a reference to another field value of type boolean (that may itself correspond to a conditional statement provided as a string).
* The syntax supporting this feature shall be specified in collaboration with the UI developer.

  .. note::

      The syntax must support e.g. ``(#air_supply.medium).rho_default`` where the first dot is used to access the property ``medium`` of the object with ``$id == #air_supply`` (which must be replaced by its value) while the second dot is used to access Modelica property ``rho_default`` of the class ``Medium`` (which must be kept literal).

An example of the resulting data structure is provided in annex, see :numref:`sec_annex_json`.


.. _sec_persisting_data:

Persisting Data
***************

Path of the Configuration File
``````````````````````````````

The path (relative to the library entry path, see *Path discovery* in :numref:`tab_gui_func`) must be stored in a hierarchical vendor annotation at the model level e.g. ``__Linkage(path="modelica://Buildings.Configuration.AHU")``.

Configuration Objects
`````````````````````

The ``value`` of all objects must be stored with their ``$id`` in a serialized format within a hierarchical vendor annotation at the model level. (This is done at the model level since some configuration data may be linked to some model declarations indirectly using dependencies so annotations at the declaration level would not cover all use cases.)

This is especially needed so that the references to the configuration data in the object declarations persist when saving and loading a model.

There are two kind of references:

* LinkageJS references prefixed by ``#`` which must be interpreted by the configuration widget and replaced by their actual value e.g. ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a(redeclare package Medium=#air_supply.medium)``.

* Modelica references provided as literal variables e.g. ``Buildings.Fluid.Movers.SpeedControlled_y(m_flow_nominal=m_flowRet_nominal)``.

Unless specified as ``final`` those references may be overwritten by the user. When loading a model the configuration widget must parse the ``$id` and ``value`` of the stored configuration data and reconstruct the corresponding model declarations using the configuration file (and interpreting the references prefixed by ``#``). Those declarations are compared to the ones present in the model: if they differ, the ones in the model take precedence.


.. _sec_fluid_connectors:

Fluid Connectors
****************

The fluid connections (``connect`` equations involving two fluid connectors) must be generated based on either:

* an explicit connection logic relying on one-to-one relationships between connectors (see :numref:`sec_explicit`) or,

* a heuristic connection logic (see :numref:`sec_heuristic`) based on:

  * the coordinates of the components in the diagram layout i.e. after converting the coordinates provided relatively to the simplified grid,

  * a tag applied to the fluid connectors (or fluid ports) of the components.

.. _sec_explicit:

Explicit Connection Logic
``````````````````````````

In certain cases it may be convenient to specify explicitly a one-to-one connection scheme between the connectors of the model e.g. a differential pressure sensor to be connected with the outlet port of a fan model and a port of a fluid source providing the reference pressure.

That logic is activated at the component level by the keyword ``connect.type == "explicit"``.

The user provides for each connector the name of the component instance and connector instance to be connected to e.g. ``"port_1": "component1.connector2``.


.. _sec_heuristic:

Heuristic Connection Logic
``````````````````````````

That logic relies on connectors tagging which supports two modes:

1. Default mode (``connect.type == "path"``)

   * By default the instances of ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a`` and ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_b`` will be suffixed ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` respectively.

   * The prefix tag is provided at the component level to specify the fluid path e.g. ``air_supply`` or ``air_return``.

   * The fluid connectors are then tagged by concatenating the previous strings e.g. ``air_supply_inlet`` or ``air_return_outlet``.

2. Detailed mode (``connect.type == "tags"``)

   * We need an additional mechanism to allow tagging each fluid port individually. Typically for a three way valve, the bypass port should be on a different fluid path than the inlet and outlet ports see :numref:`linkage_connect_3wv`. Hence we need a mapping dictionary at the connector level which, if provided, takes precedence on the default logic specified above.

   * Furthermore a fluid connector can be connected to more than one other fluid connector (fork configuration). To support that feature the concept of *derived path* is introduced: if ``fluid_path`` is the name of a fluid path, each fluid path named ``/^fluid_path_((?!_).)*$/gm`` is considered a *derived path*. The original (derived from) path is the *parent path*. A path with no parent path is referred to as *main path*.

   * For instance in case of a three way valve the mapping dictionary could be:

     ``{"port_1": "hotwater_return_inlet", "port_2": "hotwater_return_outlet", "port_3": "hotwater_supply_bypass_inlet"}`` where ``hotwater_supply_bypass`` is a derived path from ``hotwater_supply``.

.. figure:: img/linkage_connect_3wv.*
   :name: linkage_connect_3wv

   Example of the connection scheme for a three-way valve. The first diagram does not include an explicit model of the fluid junction whereas the second does (and represents the highly recommended modeling approach). This example illustrates how the fluid connection logic allows for both modeling approaches. In the first case the bypass and direct branches are derived paths from ``fluid_path0`` which consists only in one connector. In the second case they are different main paths, the bypass branch having a different direction than the direct branch (the user could also use an "explicit" connection logic to avoid the definition of an additional main fluid path).

The conversion script throws an exception if an instantiated class has ``connect.type != "explicit"`` and some fluid ports that cannot be tagged nor connected with the previous logic e.g. non default names and no (or incomplete) mapping dictionary provided.
Once the tagging is resolved for all fluid connectors of the instantiated objects with ``connect.type != "explicit"``, the connector tags are stored in a list, furthered referred to as "tagged connectors list".
All object names in that list thus reference instantiated objects with fluid ports that have to be connected to each other.

To build the full connection set, the direction (north, south, east, west) along which the objects must be connected needs to be provided for all main (not derived) fluid paths.

.. note::

   The direction (as well as the fluid medium) of a derived path are inherited from the parent path.

   Modelica ``connect`` construct is symmetric so at first glance only the vertical / horizontal direction of a fluid path seems enough. However the actual orientation along the fluid path is needed in order to identify the start and end connectors, see below.

The connection logic is then as follows:

* List all the different fluid paths in the tagged connectors list as obtained by truncating ``_inlet`` and ``_outlet`` from each connector name. Get the direction of the main fluid paths in the configuration data and finally reconstruct the tree structure of the fluid paths based on their names:

  .. code-block::

     └── fluid_path0 (direction: east): [connectors list]
       ├── fluid_path0_0 (inherited direction: east): [connectors list]
       └── fluid_path0_1 (inherited direction: east): [connectors list]
         ├── fluid_path0_1_0 (inherited direction: east): [connectors list]
         └── fluid_path0_1_1 (inherited direction: east): [connectors list]
     ├── fluid_path1 (direction: west): [connectors list]
     ├── fluid_path3 (direction: north): [connectors list]
     └── fluid_path4 (direction: south): [connectors list]

* For each fluid path:

  * Order all the connectors in the connectors list according to the direction of the fluid path and based on the position of the corresponding *objects* (not connectors) with the constraint that for each object ``inlet`` has to be listed first and ``outlet`` last.

  * For each *derived path* find the start and end connectors as described hereunder and prepend / append the connectors list.

    * If the first (resp. last) connector in the ordered list is an outlet (resp. inlet), it is the start (resp. end) connector. (Note that the reciprocal is not true: a start port can be either an inlet or an outlet see :numref:`linkage_connect_multi`.)
    * Otherwise the start (resp. end) connector is the outlet (resp. inlet) connector of the object in the parent path placed immediately before (resp. after) the object corresponding to the first (resp. last) connector -- where before and after are relative to the direction and orientation of the fluid path (which are the same for the parent path).

  *  For each *parent path* split the path into several *sub paths* whenever a connector corresponds to the start or end port of a derived path.

  * Throw an exception if one of the following rules is not verified:

    * Derived paths must start *or* end with a connector from a parent path.
    * Each branch of a fork must be a derived path, it cannot belong to the parent path: so no object from the parent path can be positioned between the objects corresponding to the first and last connector of any derived path.

  * Generate the ``connect`` equations by iterating on the ordered list of connectors and generate the connection path and the corresponding graphical annotation. The only valid connection along a fluid path is ``outlet`` with ``inlet``.

  * Populate the ``iconTransformation`` annotation of each outside connector instantiated as a dependency so that they belong to the same border (top, left, bottom, right) as in the diagram layer and be evenly positioned considering the icon's dimensions. The bus connector is an exception and will always be positioned at the top center of the icon.

The implications of that logic are the following:

* Within the same fluid path, objects are connected in a given direction and orientation: to represent a fluid loop (graphically) at least two fluid paths must be defined, typically ``supply`` and ``return``.

:numref:`linkage_connect_multi` to :numref:`linkage_connect_duct` further illustrate the connection logic on different test cases.

.. _sec_signal_connectors:

Signal Connectors
*****************

General Principles
``````````````````

Generating the ``connect`` equations for signal variables relies on:

* a (fuzzy) string matching principle applied to the names of the connector variables and their components e.g. ``com.y`` for the output connector ``y`` of the component ``com``,

* a so-called *control bus* which has the type of an expandable connector, see *§9.1.3 Expandable Connectors* in :cite:`Modelica2017`.

  (For clarity it might be useful to group control input variables in one sub-bus and control output variables in another sub-bus. The `experience feedback on bus usage in Modelica`_ shows that restricting the number of sub-buses and the use of bus variables to sensed and actuated signals only is a preferred option.)

.. _experience feedback on bus usage in Modelica: https://www.claytex.com/blog/libraries/rationalisation-bus-sub-bus-signals-engines-library

The following features of the expandable connector are leveraged:

#. All components in an expandable connector are seen as connector instances even if they are not declared as such. In comparison to a non expandable connector, that means that each variable (even of type ``Real``) can be connected i.e. be part of a ``connect`` equation.

   .. note::

      Connecting a non connector variable to a connector variable with ``connect(non_connector_var, connector_var)`` yields a warning but not an error in Dymola. It is considered bad practice though and a standard equation should be used in place ``non_connector_var = connector_var``.

      Using a ``connect`` equation allows to draw a connection line which makes the model structure explicit to the user. Furthermore it avoids mixing ``connect`` equations and standard equations within the same equation set, which has been adopted as a best practice in the Modelica Buildings library.

#. The causality (input or output) of each variable inside an expandable connector is not predefined but rather set by the ``connect`` equation where the variable is first being used. For instance when the variable of an expandable connector is first connected to an inside connector ``Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealOutput`` it gets the same causality i.e. output. The same variable can then be connected to another inside connector  ``Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput``.

#. Potentially present but not connected variables are eventually considered as undefined i.e. a tool may remove them or set them to the default value (Dymola treat them as not declared: they are not listed in ``dsin.txt``): all variables need not be connected so the control bus does not have to be reconfigured depending on the model structure.

#. The variables set of a class of type expandable connector is augmented whenever a new variable gets connected to any *instance* of the class. Though that feature is not needed by the configuration widget (we will have a predefined control bus with declared variables), it is needed to allow the user further modifying the control sequence. Adding new control variables is simply done by connecting them to the control bus.

Those features are illustrated with a minimal example in annex, see :numref:`sec_annex_bus_example`.


Generating Connections by Approximate String Matching
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To support automatic connections of signal variables a predefined control bus will be defined for each type of system (e.g. VAV, CHW plant) with a set of predeclared variables. The names of the variables must allow a one-to-one correspondence between:

* the control sequence input variables and the outputs of the equipment model e.g. sensed quantities and actuators returned positions,

* the control sequence output variables and the inputs of the equipment model e.g. actuators commanded positions.

Thus the control bus variables are used as "gateways" to stream values between the controlled system and the controller system.

However an exact string matching is not conceivable. An approximate (or fuzzy) string matching algorithm must be used instead.

Validation and Additional Requirements
``````````````````````````````````````

The use of expandable connectors (control bus) is validated in case of a complex controller, see :numref:`sec_annex_bus_valid`.

.. note::

   Connectors with conditional instances must be connected to the bus variables with the same conditional statement e.g.

   .. code:: modelica

      if have_occSen then
          connect(ahuSubBusI.nOcc[1:numZon], nOcc[1:numZon])
      end if;

   With Dymola, bus variables cannot be connected to array connectors without explicitly specifying the indices range.
   Using the unspecified ``[:]`` syntax yields the following translation error.

   .. code:: modelica

      Failed to expand conAHU.ahuSubBusI.nOcc[:] (since element does not exist) in connect(conAHU.ahuSubBusI.nOcc[:], conAHU.nOcc[:]);

   Providing an explicit indices range e.g. ``[1:numZon]`` like in the previous code snippet only causes a translation warning: Dymola seems to allocate a default dimension of **20** to the connector, the unused indices (from 3 to 20 in the example hereunder) are then removed from the simulation problem since they are not used in the model.

   .. code:: modelica

      Warning: The bus-input conAHU.ahuSubBusI.VDis_flow[3] matches multiple top-level connectors in the connection sets.

      Bus-signal: ahuI.VDis_flow[3]

      Connected bus variables:
      ahuSubBusI.VDis_flow[3] (connect) "Connector of Real output signal"
      conAHU.ahuBus.ahuI.VDis_flow[3] (connect) "Primary airflow rate to the ventilation zone from the air handler, including   outdoor air and recirculated air"
      ahuBus.ahuI.VDis_flow[3] (connect)
      conAHU.ahuSubBusI.VDis_flow[3] (connect)

   This is a strange behavior in Dymola. On the other hand JModelica 1) allows the unspecified ``[:]`` syntax and 2) does not generate any translation warning when explicitly specifying the indices range.
   JModelica's behavior seems more aligned with :cite:`Modelica2017` *§9.1.3 Expandable Connectors* that states: "A non-parameter array element may be declared with array dimensions “:” indicating that the size is unknown."
   The same logic as JModelica for array variables connections to expandable connectors is required for LinkageJS.


.. _sec_connect_ui_req:

Additional Requirements for the UI
``````````````````````````````````

Based on the previous validation case, :numref:`dymola_bus` presents the Dymola pop-up window displayed when connecting the sub-bus of input control variables to the main control bus.
A similar view of the connections set must be implemented with the additional requirements listed below. That view is displayed in the connections tab of the right panel.


.. figure:: img/dymola_bus.png
   :name: dymola_bus

   Dymola pop-up window when connecting the sub-bus of input control variables (left) to the main control bus (right) -- case of outside connectors


The variables listed immediately after the bus name are either:

* *declared variables* that are not connected e.g. ``ahuBus.yTest`` (declared as ``Real`` in the bus definition): those variables are only *potentially present* and eventually considered as *undefined* when translating the model (treated by Dymola as if they were never declared) or,

* *present variables* i.e. variables that appear in a connect equation e.g. ``ahuSubBusI.TZonHeaSet``: the icon next to each variable then indicates the causality. Those variables can originally be either declared variables or variables elaborated by the augmentation process for *that instance* of the expandable connector i.e. variables that are declared in another component and connected to the connector's instance.

The variables listed under ``Add variable`` are the remaining *potentially present variables* (in addition to the declared but not connected variables). Those variables are elaborated by the augmentation process for *all instances* of the expandable connector, however they are not connected in that instance of the connector.

In addition to Dymola's features for handling the bus connections, LinkageJS requires the following:

* Color code to distinguish between:

  * Variables connected only once (within the entire augmentation set): those variables should be listed first and in red color. This is needed so that the user immediately identify which connections are still required for the model to be complete.

    .. warning::

       Dymola does not throw any exception when a *declared* bus variable is connected to an input (resp. output) variable but not connected to any other non input (resp. non output) variable. It then uses the default value (0 for ``Real``) to feed the connected variable.

       That is not the case if the variable is not declared i.e. elaborated by augmentation: in that case it has to be connected in a consistent way.

       JModelica throws an exception in any case with the message ``The following variable(s) could not be matched to any equation``.

  * Declared variables which are only potentially present (not connected): those variables should be listed last (not first as in Dymola) and in light grey color. That behavior is also closer to :cite:`Modelica2017` *§9.1.3 Expandable Connectors*: "variables and non-parameter array elements declared in expandable connectors are marked as only being potentially present. [...] elements that are only potentially present are not seen as declared."

* View the "expanded" connection set of an expandable connector in each level of composition -- that covers several topics:

  * The user can view the connection set of a connector simply by selecting it and without having to make an actual connection (as in Dymola).

  * The user can view the name of component and connector variable to which the expandable connector's variables are connected: similar to Dymola's function ``Find Connection`` accessible by right-clicking on a connection line.

  * | From :cite:`Modelica2017` *§9.1.3 Expandable Connectors*: "When two expandable connectors are connected, each is augmented with the variables that are only declared in the other expandable connector (the new variables are neither input nor output)."
    | That feature is illustrated in the minimal example :numref:`bus_minimal` where a sub-bus ``subBus`` with declared variables ``yDeclaredPresent`` and ``yDeclaredNotPresent`` is connected to the declared sub-bus ``bus.ahuI`` of a bus. ``yDeclaredPresent`` is connected to another variable so it is considered present. ``yDeclaredNotPresent`` is not connected so it is only considered potentially present. Finally ``yNotDeclaredPresent`` is connected but not declared which makes it a present variable. :numref:`subbus_outside` to :numref:`bus_inside` then show which variables are exposed to the user. In consistency with :cite:`Modelica2017` the declared variables of ``subBus`` are considered declared variables in ``bus.ahuI`` due to the connect equation between those two instances and they are neither input nor output. Furthermore the present variable ``yNotDeclaredPresent`` appears in ``bus.ahuI`` under ``Add variable`` i.e. as a potentially present variable whereas it is a present variable in the connected sub-bus ``subBus``.

    * This is an issue for the user who will not have the information at the bus level of the connections which are required by the sub-bus variables e.g. Dymola will allow connecting an output connector to ``bus.ahuI.yDeclaredPresent`` but the translation of the model will fail due to ``Multiple sources for causal signal in the same connection set``.
    * Directly connecting variables to the bus (without intermediary sub-bus) can solve that issue for outside connectors but not for inside connectors, see below.

  * | Another issue is illustrated :numref:`bus_inside` where the connection to the bus is now made from an outside component for which the bus is considered as an inside connector. Here Dymola only displays declared variables of the bus (but not of the sub-bus) but without the causality information and even if it is only potentially present (not connected). Present variables of the bus or sub-bus which are not declared are not displayed. Contrary to Dymola, LinkageJS requires that the "expanded" connection set of an expandable connector be exposed, independently from the level of composition. That means exposing all the variables of the *augmentation set* as defined in :cite:`Modelica2017` *9.1.3 Expandable Connectors*. In our example the same information displayed in :numref:`subbus_outside` for the original sub-bus should be accessible when displaying the connection set of ``bus.ahuI`` whatever the current status (inside or outside) of the connector ``bus``. A typical view of the connection set of expandable connectors for LinkageJS could be:
