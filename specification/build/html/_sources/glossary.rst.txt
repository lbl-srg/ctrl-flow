   Analog Value
     In CDL, we say a value is analog if it represents a continuous
     number. The value may be presented by an analog signal such as
     voltage, or by a digital signal.

   Binary Value
     In CDL, we say a value is binary if it can take on the values
     0 and 1. The value may however be presented by an analog signal
     that can take on two values (within some tolerance) in order
     to communicate the binary value.

   Building Model
     Digital model of the physical behavior of a given building over time,
     which accounts for any elements of the building envelope and includes a
     representation of internal gains and occupancy. Building model has connectors
     to be coupled with an environment model and any HVAC and non-HVAC system models
     pertaining to the building.
