Modelica Graphical User Interface
---------------------------------

Generating Connections
******************************

When drawing a connection line between two connector icons:

* a ``connect`` equation with the references to the two connectors is created,

* with a graphical annotation defining the connection path as an array of points and providing an optional smoothing function e.g. Bezier.

    * When no smoothing function is specified the connection path must be rendered graphically as a set of segments.

    * The array of points is either:

        * created fully automatically when the next user's click after having started a connection is made on a connector icon. The function call ``create_new_path(connector1, connector2)`` creates the minimum number of *vertical or horizontal* segments to link the two connector icons with the constraint of avoiding overlaying any instantiated object,

        * created semi automatically based on the input points corresponding to the user clicks outside any connector icon: the function call ``create_new_path(point[i], point[i+1])`` is called to generate the path linking each pair of points together.

Configuration Widget
--------------------

Functionalities
***************

The configuration widget allows the user to generate a Modelica model of an HVAC system and its controls by filling up a simple input form.
There are two fundamental requirements regarding the generated model:

1. It must be "graphically readable" (both within LinkageJS and within any third-party Modelica GUI e.g. Dymola): this is a strong constraint regarding the connections that must be generated automatically.

2. It must be ready to simulate: no additional modeling work or parameters setting is needed outside the configuration widget.

The input form is provided by the developer (LBNL) in a data model with a format that is to be specified.

The data model typically provides for each entry:

* the HTML widget and populating data to be used for requesting user input,
* the modeling data required to instantiate, position and set up the parameters of the different components,
* some tags to be used to automatically generate the connections between the different components connectors.

The user interface logic is illustrated in figures :numref:`screen_conf_0` and :numref:`screen_conf_1`.

.. figure:: img/screen_conf_0.svg
      :name: screen_conf_0

      Configuration widget -- Configuring a new model

.. figure:: img/screen_conf_1.svg
      :name: screen_conf_1

      Configuration widget -- Configuring an existing model

The envisioned data model supporting this logic is illustrated in :numref:`code_conf_ahu` where:

* the components referenced under the ``equipment`` name are connected together in one dedicated equipment model,

* the components referenced under the ``controls`` name are connected together in one dedicated controls model,

* the components referenced under the ``dependencies`` name are part of the equipment model:

      * they typically correspond to sensors and outside fluid connectors,
      * the model completeness depends on their presence,
      * the requirements for their presence can be deduced from the equipment and controls options,
      * they do not need additional fields in the user form of the configuration widget.

* the equipment and controls models are connected together by means of a `control bus`, see :numref:`screen_schematics_modelica`: the upper-level model including the equipment and controls models is the ultimate output of the configuration widget (see :numref:`screen_conf_1` where the component named ``AHU_1_01_02`` represents an instance of the upper-level model ``AHU_1`` generated by the widget). That component exposes the outside fluid connectors as well as the top level control bus.

.. note::

      The pseudo code in :numref:`code_conf_ahu` uses functions such as ``find_equipment`` or ``find_parameter`` to simplify the syntax when auto referencing the data structure.

      To solve:

            * Test headered VS dedicated chilled water pump: conditional number of instances, placement and fluid path. Idea: the first dedicated pump can be instantiated in the equipment section, the others in the dependencies section.

            * Conditional dependencies: model and placement require ``if then`` statements e.g. AFMS depending on economizer dampers option.

            * Best format: JSON (expensive especially for boolean conditions), Python class, MapperClass from NREL URBANopt GeoJSON...

            * Controls specification based on a standard

                  * Top level controller with a list of parameters to be exposed as control options e.g.:

                        * when they condition the model structure e.g. ``use_enthalpy`` requires an additional enthalpy sensor,

                        * when they condition the dimension or instanciation of some connectors e.g. ``numZon``, ``have_occSen``.

                        * when no default value is provided e.g. ``AFlo`` cf. requirement that the model generated by the configuration widget must be ready to simulate.

                  * The other parameters are accessible outside of the configuration widget through the parameters panel.

                  * `to be updated`: having high level parameters exposed in the configuration widget and low level parameters exposed in the parameters panel is confusing.

                  * The alternative is to have a list of controller options for each equipment, the options are made available based on the standard selected (if any).

                        * To be tested: can the "fluid path" mechanism also support

                        * The connections between the different control blocks rely on the control bus.

The logic for instantiating classes from the library is straightforward. Each field of the form specifies:

* the path of the class to be instantiated depending on the user input;

* the position of the component in simplified grid coordinates to be converted in diagram view coordinates.

The next paragraphs address how the connections between the connectors of the different components are generated automatically based on this initial model structure.

Fluid Connectors
****************

The fluid connections (``connect`` equations involving two fluid connectors) are generated based on :

* the coordinates of the components in the diagram view,
* a tag applied to the components' connectors.

That tag can be automatically generated for components with the two following fluid ports (most common case):

* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a``: inlet
* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_b``: outlet

For components with more than two fluid ports e.g. coil, the variable name could be used:

* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a1``: primary fluid (liquid) inlet
* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a2``: secondary fluid (air) inlet

However that logic fails when the ports correspond to the same medium e.g.:

* ``Buildings.Fluid.Actuators.Dampers.MixingBox``: ``port_Out, port_Exh, port_Ret, port_Sup``
* ``Buildings.Fluid.Actuators.Valves.ThreeWayEqualPercentageLinear``: ``port_1, port_2, port_3``
* ``Buildings.Fluid.HeatExchangers.PlateHeatExchangerEffectivenessNTU``: ``port_a1, port_a2, port_b1, port_b2``

So the following logic is considered:

1. Default mode

      * By default ``port_a`` and ``port_b`` will be tagged as ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` respectively.

      * An optional tag is provided at the component level to specify the fluid path e.g. ``air_supply`` or ``air_return``.

      * All fluid connectors are then tagged by concatenating the previous tags e.g. ``air_supply_inlet`` or ``air_return_outlet``.

2. Detailed mode

      * | We need an additional mechanism to allow tagging each fluid port individually. Typically for a three way valve, the bypass port should be on a different fluid path than the inlet and outlet ports see :numref:`linkage_connect_3wv`. Hence we need a mapping dictionary at the connector level which, if provided, takes precedence on the default logic specified above.
        | Furthermore a fluid connector can be connected to more than one other fluid connector. To support that feature another connector tag value is needed: ``junction``.

      * For a three way valve without any flow splitter to explicitly model the fluid junction the mapping dictionary could be:

        ``{"port_1": "hotwater_return_inlet", "port_2": "hotwater_return_outlet", "port_3": "hotwater_supply_junction"}``

.. figure:: img/linkage_connect_3wv.svg
      :name: linkage_connect_3wv

      Connection scheme with a fluid junction not modeled explicitly, using the connector tag ``junction``

.. figure:: img/linkage_connect_multi.svg
      :name: linkage_connect_multi

      Connection scheme with a fluid junction not modeled explicitly, using a dedicated fluid path

The conversion script throws an exception if the instantiated class has some fluid ports that cannot be tagged with the previous logic e.g. non default names and no (or incomplete) mapping dictionary provided.

If the tagging is resolved for all fluid connectors of the instantiated objects the connector tags are stored in a hierarchical vendor annotation at the model level e.g. ``__Linkage_connect(Tags(object_name1={connector_name1=air_supply_inlet, connector_name2=air_supply_outlet, ...}, ...))``. This is done when updating the model.

All object names in ``__Linkage_tags(Tags())`` annotation reference instantiated objects with fluid ports that have to be connected to each other. To build the full connection set, two additional inputs are needed:

1. The names of the start port and the end port for each fluid path.

   .. note::
      Those ports may be part of a different fluid path see ``fluid_path1`` in :numref:`linkage_connect_multi`.

      Furthermore this a stringent limitation of that approach: if the structure of the model is complex, the start or end port of a specific fluid path can be hard to determine due to intricate boolean conditions. Allowing multiple tags for a single connector could be a better solution?

2. The direction (horizontal or vertical) of the connection path.

Those inputs are stored in ``__Linkage_connect(Direction(fluid_path1={start_connector_name, end_connector_name, horizontal_or_vertical}))``.

The connection logic is then as follows:

* List all the different fluid paths in ``__Linkage_connect(Tags())`` corresponding to each tuple ``{fluid}_{path}`` in all the connector tags ``{fluid}_{path}_{port}``.

* For each fluid path:

      * Find the position of the objects corresponding to the start and end ports specified in ``__Linkage_connect(Direction(fluid_path1={start_connector_name, end_connector_name}))``. Those are further referred to as start and end position.

      * | Find the orientation (up, down, right, left) of the direction (horizontal, vertical) of the connection path by comparing the ``x`` (resp. ``y``) coordinate values of the start and end position if the direction is horizontal (resp. vertical).

        | Throw an exception if the orientation cannot be resolved due to identical coordinate values.

      * Order all the connectors belonging to that fluid path according to the orientation defined here above and based on the position of the corresponding objects with the constraint that for each object ``inlet`` has to be listed first and ``outlet`` last. Prepend / append that list with the start and end connectors.

      * Generate the ``connect`` equations by iterating on the ordered list of connectors as illustrated in the pseudo code below. And generate the connection path and the corresponding graphical annotation::

            i = 1
            while i < n
            j = i + 1
            if type(ordered_connector[i]) == "junction"
                  while type(ordered_connector[j]) == "junction"
                        connect(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])
                        annotation(Line(points=create_new_path(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])))
                        j = j + 1
                  i = j
            else
                  connect(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])
                  annotation(Line(points=create_new_path(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])))
                  i = j + 1

        The only valid connections are ``junction`` with ``junction`` and ``outlet`` with ``inlet``: throw an exception otherwise.

        :numref:`linkage_connect_junction` further illustrates the logic for connecting ``junction`` ports.

.. figure:: img/linkage_connect_junction.svg
      :name: linkage_connect_junction

      Logic of ports connection in case of ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` ports (top) and ``junction`` ports (bottom)

The implications of that logic are the following:

* Within the same fluid path, objects are connected in a given direction and orientation: to represent a fluid loop (graphically) at least two fluid paths must be defined, typically ``supply`` and ``return``.

* A same fluid path does not necessarily imply a uniform flow rate.

* Among the multiple connectors which are part of the same junction, only one can have a paired ``outlet`` connector (part of the same component) within the same fluid path and the corresponding component must be placed further downstream. There is always the modeling alternative which consists in representing a junction by introducing a new fluid path as in :numref:`linkage_connect_multi`.

Signal Connectors
*****************

Generating the ``connect`` equations for signal variables relies on string matching with the names of the variables declared in a a so-called `control bus` which has the type of an expandable connector type, see *§9.1.3
Expandable Connectors* in :cite:`Modelica2017`.

The following features of the expandable connector are leveraged:

#. All components in an expandable connector are seen as connector instances even if they are not declared as such. In comparison to a non expandable connector, that means that each variable (even of type ``Real``) can be connected i.e. be part of a ``connect`` equation.

   .. note::

      * Connecting a non connector variable to a connector variable with ``connect(non_connector_var, connector_var)`` yields a warning but not an error. It is considered bad practice though and a standard equation should be used in place ``non_connector_var = connector_var``.

      * Using a ``connect`` equation allows to draw a connection line which makes the model structure explicit to the user. Furthermore it avoids mixing ``connect`` equations and standard equations within the same equation set, which has been adopted as a best practice in the Modelica Buildings library.

#. The causality (input or output) of each variable inside an expandable connector is not predefined but rather set by the ``connect`` equation where the variable is first being used. For instance when a variable is first connected to an inside connector ``Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealOutput`` it gets the same causality i.e. output. The same variable can then be connected to another inside connector  ``Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput``.

#. Possibly present but not connected variable is considered not declared: all variables need not be connected so the `control bus` does not have to be reconfigured depending on the model structure.

#. The variables set of a class of type expandable connector is expanded whenever a new variable gets connected to any *instance* of the class. Though that feature is not needed by the configuration widget (we will have a predefined `control bus` with declared variables corresponding to the control sequences implemented for each system), it is needed to allow the user further modifying the control sequence. Adding new control variables is simply done by connecting them to the `control bus`.

Those features are illustrated with a minimal example in the figures below where:

* a controlled system consisting in a sensor (idealized with a real expression) and an actuator (idealized with a simple block passing through the value of the input control signal) is connected with,

* a controller system which divides the input variable (measurement) by itself and outputs a control variable equal to one.

* The same model is first implemented with an expandable connector and then with a standard connector.

      end BusTestControlledExp;

.. code:: modelica

      expandable connector AhuBus
      extends Modelica.Icons.SignalBus;
      end AhuBus;

.. note::

      The definition of ``AhuBus`` in the code snippet here above does not include any variable declaration. However the variables ``ahuBus.yAct`` and ``ahuBus.yMea`` are used in ``connect`` equations. That is only possible with an expandable connector.

      For the configuration widget we will have predeclared variables with names allowing a one-to-one correspondence between:

      * the control sequence input variables and the outputs of the equipment model e.g. measured quantities and actuators returned positions,

      * the control sequence output variables and the inputs of the equipment model e.g. actuators commanded positions.

      The control bus variables are used as "gateways" to stream values between the controlled and controller systems.

      For clarity it might be useful to group control input variables in one sub-bus and control output variables in another sub-bus.
      The `experience feedback on bus usage in Modelica`_ shows that restricting the number of sub-buses and the use of bus variables to sensed and actuated signals only is a preferred option: the number of signals passing through busses has an impact on the number of equations and the simulation time.

Loading a Modelica Model with LinkageJS Annotations
===================================================

Issue: the model might have been edited manually by the user.

* If some components are not found in Linkage annotations, the configuration widget is disabled.
* Or we try to reconstruct the fluid paths based on the updated connection set and the existing Linkage annotations. Every new component gets included in the configuration data model (additional section).

      From https://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors.html

      With the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly select the medium model for each component in a circuit. This model is then propagated to the ports, and a Modelica translator will check that the quantity and unit attributes of connected interfaces are identical. Therefore, an error occurs, if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium with the same medium name. In the future, automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports will be introduced, but this still not possible with Modelica 3.0.
