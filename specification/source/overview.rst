Overview
========

The software relies on two main components.

#. A graphical user interface for editing Modelica models in a diagrammatic form, see :numref:`sec_functionalities` and :numref:`sec_modelica_gui`.

#. A configuration widget supporting assisted modeling based on a simple HTML input form, see :numref:`sec_configuration_widget`.

We envision a phased development where

#. the configuration widget would be first implemented and integrated into an existing graphical editor for Modelica,

#. the full-featured editor would be developed in a second phase, providing diagrammatic editing capabilities and integrating the configuration widget natively.
